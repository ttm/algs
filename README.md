# Algorithms for Algorithmia

## Possible algorithms
* KS test statistics for two samples of data
* KS test statistics for a sample of data and a set of chosen distributions
* Incidence of words in reference literature (e.g. Bible, Shakespeare, Machado de Assis)
* POS tagging Portuguese texts
* Wordnet hypernyms and other relations for words
* Wordnet statistics for texts
* Formating and performing sparql queries given a set of triples
* TFIdF derived measures for sets of texts
* Erdos sectioning for a network or a distribution or a sample (derive distribution and compare with binomial)
* Erd√∂s sectioning for sequences of net/dist/samp
* Compare POS tags and other text-related measures with those found im email
* PCA of samples or sets of samples
* Circular statistics of manifolds
* KS statistics form sets of texts
* Make music from data
